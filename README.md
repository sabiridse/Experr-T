# Experr-T
This project is also educational. This is the development of the first Exports Project. Project EXperr-T is already a full desktop application for automating business processes on my current work on monitoring the network of payment terminals. The program receives the import of the statuses and statuses of all network terminals from all payment systems (2-3) and allows you to monitor the entire network on one screen, automatically send letters to technical experts about terminal errors, keep track of terminals and error history, and generate reports for management. Information is stored in the DB of MySQL. In this project there is still no work with ORM Spring Maven ... only JAVA and JDBC with requests for pure MySQL.
